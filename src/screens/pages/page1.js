</h1>
<p>
  I have great respect for you, which will never leave my heart. The guidance
  you have provided me as a mentor, teacher, or manager is something I will
  never forget. Whatever professional etiquette I have, all credit goes to you.
  I always admire the suggestions and feedback you have given me over the last
  4.5 years. I will carry them with me throughout my life.
</p>
<p>
  You are such a good person. I understand that sometimes your job requires you
  to give harsh guidance, but I have always taken your input as a teacher. You
  have done a great job from a managerial perspective. I never feel like you
  are just a manager; I always see you as my teacher. Whenever you explain
  something, I pay full attention because I know I am learning valuable
  lessons from your words, and the respect I have for you is earned.
</p>
<p>
  I still remember when I was first assigned under you and given tasks. Those
  memories are very dear to me. It felt like a challenge, especially working
  with Shyla and Sandhya. I used to see others as my competitors, thinking I
  had to prove myself as the best, but looking back, it was a childish
  perspective, yet memorable.
</p>
<p>
  You have always been supportive and kind to me. Whenever I needed help,
  whether it was work from home or leave, you were always ready to support me.
  Your support has been invaluable to me, both professionally and personally.
</p>
<p>
  I am very excited for the future, knowing that I carry skills and memories
  that we built together. Please stay connected with me for a lifetime, and
  feel free to call me whenever you want. ðŸŒŸ
