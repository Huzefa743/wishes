  Hello, <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>Fashion Stylist</span>! ðŸ‘‹
</h1>
<p>
You are such a good soul what i observe throughout the years. Beauty with style you are such a good person as a colleague and friend. I always try to reach you out whenever i heard a trendy news or gossip about the office either its a hike news, layed off news or any promotion news i still remember together we use to make the plan how soon we are going to leave this company so will not see bibhuti face ever.
</p>
<p>
Initially i know i was assuming you as a competitor since you are also nodejs developer i used to hide the requirement and skills set from you but later of time I realised you are far better then me in all prospective and i should now see you as compititor beacuse you are very good person by heart.
</p>
<p>
By seeing you and talking with you donâ€™t know but some flirting words will come out from my mouth thatâ€™s total naturally because you have such personality i am missing you are not here so i could see you at least by face last time but its my bad I couldnâ€™t. But always connect with me over whatsapp or Instagram so i can get a chance to see you.
</p>
<p>
You have all the potential i am feeling you are wasting your talent here please try to join some better opportunity i can see you have all the current market skills set which can be irreplaceable in next 5 year.
</p>
<p>
Please forgive if anything i did wrong or some bad talk i done with you and wishing you all the very best and please donâ€™t forgot to call me in your marriage.

</p>
